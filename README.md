# Farkle Command-Line Game

An interactive command-line implementation of the classic dice game Farkle, built in Python. This project demonstrates functional programming principles, unit testing with Pytest, and behavior-driven development using Behave.

## Features
- **Gameplay:** Implements Farkle's rules, scoring system, and turn logic.
- **Functional Programming:** Modular, immutable code design.
- **Testing:** Unit tests (`farkle_test.py`) and BDD scenarios (`Behave`).
