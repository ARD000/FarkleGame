Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) for Farkle Game
This folder contains the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) components for the Farkle Command-Line Game. These components define the game's expected behavior and provide step definitions to test it.

ðŸ“‹ Features
File: GherkinFeatures.feature
This file contains scenarios written in Gherkin syntax that describe the game's expected behavior.
Example scenario:
Scenario: Display Greeting and Rules
Given the system is started
When the system loads
Then I should see a greeting message
And I should see the rules of the game printed out
ðŸ§© Step Definitions
File: steps.py
This Python file contains the implementation of the steps defined in the feature file. It uses the Behave framework to execute these steps.
Example step:
@then('I should see a greeting message')
def step_greeting_message(context):
print("Welcome to Farkle!")
assert "Welcome to Farkle!" in "Welcome to Farkle!"
ðŸ”§ How to Run the Tests
To verify the behavior of the Farkle game, you can run the BDD tests using the Behave framework.

Install Dependencies:
Ensure you have Python and the Behave library installed:
pip install behave

Run the Tests:
Execute the tests from the project directory:
behave features/

Expected Output:
The tests will validate the scenarios defined in the GherkinFeatures.feature file. The output will indicate whether the tests passed or failed.

ðŸ“‚ File Structure
GherkinFeatures.feature: Contains Gherkin scenarios for the Farkle game.
steps.py: Python step definitions for the scenarios.
ðŸš€ Purpose
These files demonstrate how Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is used to ensure the game's rules and flow are implemented correctly. This approach ensures the game adheres to its functional requirements and provides a smooth user experience.
